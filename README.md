Welcome to **New York City**, one of the most-visited cities in the world! With thousands of Airbnb listings available across its five boroughs, NYC offers a wide range of options for travelers seeking short- or long-term stays. In this project, we explore and analyze the **New York City Airbnb market** using data from multiple sources and formats.

## 📊 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to gain insights into the Airbnb landscape in NYC by:
- Understanding listing prices and their distribution across neighborhoods
- Exploring room types and their descriptions
- Analyzing host activity based on the last review dates

We combine data from three different formats: `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx` to practice data integration and wrangling.
